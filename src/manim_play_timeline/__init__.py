def play_timeline(scene: Scene, timeline: dict[float, Union[Iterable[Animation], Animation]]):
    """
    Plays a timeline of animations on a given scene.
    Args:
        scene (Scene): The scene to play the animations on.
        timeline (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the times at which the animations should start,
            and the values are the animations to play at that time. The values can be a single animation
            or an iterable of animations.
        
    Notes:
        Each animation in the timeline can have a different duration, so several animations can be
        running in parallel. If the value for a given time is an iterable, all the animations
        in the iterable are started at once (although they can end at different times depending
        on their run_time)
        The method returns when all animations have finished playing.
    Returns:
        None
